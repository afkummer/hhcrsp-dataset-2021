Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 84 with skills = {0,-1} and cost = 45.3
   Vehicle #0 = 1, leaving at = 735.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 6.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     4.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         6.0
