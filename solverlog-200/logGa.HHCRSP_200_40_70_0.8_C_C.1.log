Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 33 with skills = {0,-1} and cost = 368.3
   Vehicle #0 = 0, leaving at = 897.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 3.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     1.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         3.0
