Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 62 with skills = {5,-1} and cost = 770.3
   Vehicle #0 = 63, leaving at = 836.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 9.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     10.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         9.0
