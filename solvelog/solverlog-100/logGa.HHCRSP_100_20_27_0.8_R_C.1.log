Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 32 with skills = {0,-1} and cost = 277.3
   Vehicle #0 = 8, leaving at = 746.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 7.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     4.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         7.0
