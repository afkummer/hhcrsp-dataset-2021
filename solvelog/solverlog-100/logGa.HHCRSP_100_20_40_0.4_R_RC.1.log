Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 32 with skills = {5,-1} and cost = 305.0
   Vehicle #0 = 15, leaving at = 970.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 9.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     3.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         9.0
