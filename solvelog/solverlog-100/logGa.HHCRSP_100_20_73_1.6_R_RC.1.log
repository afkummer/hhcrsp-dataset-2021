Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 68 with skills = {4,-1} and cost = 352.7
   Vehicle #0 = 12, leaving at = 991.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 6.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         6.0
