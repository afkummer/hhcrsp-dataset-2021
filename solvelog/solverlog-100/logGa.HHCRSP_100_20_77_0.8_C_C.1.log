Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 40 with skills = {0,-1} and cost = 356.3
   Vehicle #0 = 8, leaving at = 995.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 5.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         5.0
