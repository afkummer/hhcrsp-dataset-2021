Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 40 with skills = {0,5} and cost = 148.3
   Vehicle #0 = 4, leaving at = 782.0
   Vehicle #1 = 12, leaving at = 805.0
   Increment on distance indicator: 8.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     1.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         8.0
