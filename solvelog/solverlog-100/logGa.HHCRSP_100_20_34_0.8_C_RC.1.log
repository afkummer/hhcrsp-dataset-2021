Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 3 with skills = {0,4} and cost = 252.7
   Vehicle #0 = 4, leaving at = 844.0
   Vehicle #1 = 18, leaving at = 868.0
   Increment on distance indicator: 24.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     4.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         24.0
