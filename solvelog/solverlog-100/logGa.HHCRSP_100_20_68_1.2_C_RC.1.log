Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 29 with skills = {1,-1} and cost = 319.0
   Vehicle #0 = 7, leaving at = 1004.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 2.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         2.0
