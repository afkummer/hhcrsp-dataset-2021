Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 9 with skills = {0,-1} and cost = 567.0
   Vehicle #0 = 2, leaving at = 906.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 4.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         4.0
