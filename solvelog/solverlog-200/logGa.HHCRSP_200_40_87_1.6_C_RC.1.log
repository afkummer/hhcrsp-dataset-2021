Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 94 with skills = {2,-1} and cost = 530.0
   Vehicle #0 = 7, leaving at = 1005.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 5.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         5.0
