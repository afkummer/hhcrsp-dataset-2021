Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 80 with skills = {2,-1} and cost = 343.0
   Vehicle #0 = 7, leaving at = 897.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 4.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     2.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         4.0
