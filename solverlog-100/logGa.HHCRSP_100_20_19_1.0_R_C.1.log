Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 79 with skills = {4,-1} and cost = 209.7
   Vehicle #0 = 15, leaving at = 966.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 7.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         7.0
