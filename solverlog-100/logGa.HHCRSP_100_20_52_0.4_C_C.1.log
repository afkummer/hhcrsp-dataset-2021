Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 34 with skills = {4,-1} and cost = 258.7
   Vehicle #0 = 19, leaving at = 994.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 8.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     1.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         8.0
